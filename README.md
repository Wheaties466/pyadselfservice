## Python Active Directory Self Service (pyadselfservice)

#####pyadselfservice is a software created using Python 3.10.12 & Django 5.0. The project aims to provide web based password change portal to the end users, for their Active Directory account. Users will need to authenticate using a 2 factor authentication mechanism to change password of thier AD account. This tool does not need the current password, and the password change will work even if the account is locked out.

2 factor authentication is based on OTP and a secret defned in any of the Active Directory attributes.

The documentation for this software is in below link
