## Python Active Directory Self Service (pyadselfservice)

#####pyadselfservice is a software created using Python 3.10.12 & Django 5.0. The project aims to provide web based password change portal to the end users, for their Active Directory account. Users will not need to enter their current password. Upon successful authentication, this tool unlocks and change the password to what is entered by user on the final page. Which means users can change their password even if they have forgotten their current password, and if their account is locked.
The tool authenticates users based on 2 factor authentication. The first factor being the attributes defined in the Active Directory and the second factor being OTP.

The documentation for this software is in below link
